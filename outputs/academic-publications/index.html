to enhance digital service access for Minority Ethnic (ME) communities, specifically drawing on the Protecting Minority
Ethnic Communities Online (PRIME) project. The framework leverages ML models to derive unbiased decision-making rules,
influencing ABM simulations that explore online service perceptions based on individual attributes and environmental
factors. It facilitates comprehensive analysis of agent interactions, policy impacts, and service provider
characteristics, aiming to improve online service experiences across health, energy, and social housing domains. By
integrating ML with ABM, the framework addresses key challenges in model design, variable handling, and validation,
using empirical data and expert knowledge. The framework’s adaptability supports detailed examination of enablers and
constraints affecting minority ethnic communities’ online service usage, promoting equitable policy decisions and
service delivery improvements. Future extensions include optimization for equitable outcomes and threat modelling for
secure online service access.</p><a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10712582 target=_blank class="btn btn-primary">Read more</a><h2 id=a-data-driven-approach-to-understanding-online-service-access-and-technological-energy-injustice-among-minority-ethnic-communities><strong>A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Online Service Access and Technological Energy Injustice Among Minority Ethnic Communities</strong></h2><h3 id=mennan-guder-and-nazmiye-balta-ozkan-1><strong>Mennan Guder and Nazmiye Balta-Ozkan</strong></h3><p>In the energy domain, various forms of injustice manifest, spanning distribution, production, access, environmental, economic, social, inter-generational, technological, cultural, and governance realms. This paper delves into the technological injustice regarding online service access by energy suppliers, specifically focusing on its impact on energy poverty among minority ethnic communities. The Ofgem Consumer Impacts of Market Conditions Survey Wave 3 Report highlights significant challenges within the energy market, particularly affecting minority ethnic communities. Despite initiatives to investigate legal services for minority ethnic communities, exploration of online service utilization remains inadequate, creating a significant gap in understanding. This paper proposes a comprehensive examination of online service usage and perceptions within minority ethnic communities to address this research gap.
The proposed framework encompasses modules for survey construction, data analysis, Machine Learning (ML) integration, and Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) and simulation. Feature examination reveals correlations between accommodation type and online service satisfaction, influencing simulations. The ABM module simulates how changes in accommodation type affect online service satisfaction, with ML models predicting outcomes. Validation through empirical data and expert knowledge ensures model accuracy. This research contributes to understanding online service experiences, particularly for minority ethnic communities, aiming to empower researchers and service providers to address inequalities effectively. Future work involves expanding the ABM to incorporate threat modelling concepts, providing a tool for assessing and fortifying the security posture of online services for minority ethnic communities.</p><a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3698062.3698094 target=_blank class="btn btn-primary">Read more</a><h2 id=digital-solutions-for-migrant-and-refugee-health-a-framework-for-analysis-and-action><strong>Digital Solutions for Migrant and Refugee Health: A Framework for Analysis and Action</strong></h2><h3 id=stephen-a-matlin-johanna-hanefeld-ana-corte-real-paulo-rupino-da-cunha-thea-de-gruchy-karima-noorali-manji->Stephen A.

To explore the impacts of digitalisation on access to and use of primary care services among minoritised ethnic communities in the UK. 100 minoritised ethnic adults who identify as Black African, Black Caribbean, Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, and of mixed or multiple ethnic heritage in four sites in the UK were purposively recruited and interviewed. Interviews were thematically analysed to increase understanding of how individuals’ ethnicity intersects with other characteristics (e.g. language, age, gender, socio-economic status) to identify constraints and enablements to accessing healthcare. Minoritised ethnic individuals’ access to digital primary care is impeded by factors such as digital precarity (e.g. inadequate devices, internet connectivity and digital literacy skills), a lack of language support and staff shortcomings in responding to ethnically diverse populations. Intergenerational support and bespoke offerings by general practices in some areas enable some individuals to overcome some of the constraints. The rapid digitalisation of primary care services is replicating and potentially exacerbating barriers to using these services among minoritised ethnic communities, a finding which merits urgent attention by practitioners and policymakers.</p><a href=https://bjgp.org/content/74/749/e823 target=_blank class="btn btn-primary">Read more</a><h2 id=minority-ethnic-vulnerabilities-in-the-use-of-digital-housing-services-across-age-groups><strong>Minority Ethnic Vulnerabilities in the Use of Digital Housing Services Across Age Groups</strong></h2><h3 id=sacha-hasan-and-yingfang-yuan--european-network-for-housing-research-conference-2023><strong>Sacha Hasan and Yingfang Yuan | European Network for Housing Research Conference 2023</strong></h3><p>Despite the accelerated digitalisation of social housing services, there has been a lack of focused attention to the harms that are likely to arise through the systemic inequalities encountered by minoritised ethnic (ME) communities in the UK.

We draw our findings from an interdisciplinary sentimental analysis of 100 interviews with ME individuals in Glasgow, Bradford, Manchester and Tower Hamlets for extracting vulnerabilities and assessing their intensities across different ME age groups, and a subsample of qualitative analysis of 21 interviews. This is to illustrate similarities and differences of sentimental analysis of these vulnerabilities between machine learning (ML) and inductive coding, offering an example for future ML supported qualitative data analysis approach in housing studies.</p><a href=https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jtc8k_v1 target=_blank class="btn btn-primary">Read more</a><h2 id=valuing-lived-experience-and-co-design-solutions-to-counter-racial-inequality-in-data-and-algorithmic-systems-in-the-uks-digital-services><strong>Valuing Lived Experience and Co-Design Solutions to Counter Racial Inequality in Data and Algorithmic Systems in the UK’s Digital Services</strong></h2><h3 id=aunam-quyoum-and-mark-wong--information-communication--society-2024><strong>Aunam Quyoum and Mark Wong | Information, Communication & Society, 2024</strong></h3><p>This paper argues it is imperative to understand, and value, racialised minorities’ lived experience to inform and improve digital services’ design to be more inclusive and equitable.

With the massive push towards the rapid digital transformation of primary health services in recent times, which has been accelerated since the emergence of the Covid pandemic, there is a risk that racialised exclusions will increase. We highlight a spectrum of digital mobilities among individuals from diverse ethnic groups and multiple identities in engaging with primary care services, ranging from complete digital immobility to complete mobility. Within this spectrum, others get by, assisted in some cases by a cluster of local resources, such as support from relatives or neighbours or bilingual staff within the health service, and often at the cost of loss of privacy. However, their access to health services remains conditional on the availability and suitability of these supports, leading us to propose the concept of ‘digital precarity’ to illuminate their often tenuous relationship with ever-changing digital health services.</p><a href=https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/publications/digital-mobilities-and-immobilities-in-accessing-health-services- target=_blank class="btn btn-primary">Read more</a><h2 id=racialised-exclusions-in-digital-healthcare-combining-insights-from-narrative-interviews-and-human-computer-interaction><strong>Racialised Exclusions in Digital Healthcare: Combining Insights from Narrative Interviews and Human-Computer Interaction</strong></h2><h3 id=farjana-islam-sara-bailey-mehdi-rizvi-gina-netto-and-agnes-kukulska-hulme--qualitative-health-research-network-conference-2024><strong>Farjana Islam, Sara Bailey, Mehdi Rizvi, Gina Netto, and Agnes Kukulska-Hulme | Qualitative Health Research Network Conference 2024</strong></h3><p>There is a limited understanding of the extent to which ME communities encounter systemic exclusions from digital healthcare services that require English language skills, literacy skills, accessibility to a device (e.g., a computer or smartphone), mobile data, and the skills and confidence to navigate digital platforms.

By deploying a two-tier qualitative methodology combining 100 in-depth narrative interviews with follow-up audio-visual interviews that draw on human-computer interaction (HCI) methodologies, we explore how digitalised health services intersect with ethnicity and other ethnocultural dimensions to contribute to digital exclusion from healthcare services.

However, the ONS data used to support this claim were not disaggregated by age or specific ethnic group. The disaggregated data demonstrate that internet usage among older (55+) individuals who identify specifically as Asian or Asian British is significantly lower than for White individuals from the same age groups. To date, interviews have been conducted with 100 individuals who identify as ethnic minorities including approximately 30 over-55s who identify as Asian or Asian British. The majority of the subsample of 30 stated that they struggle to use digital health, social housing and/or energy platforms due to inadequate access to technology and connectivity (the first level of the digital divide) and/or limited digital skills (the second level of the digital divide). Taken together with ONS data on internet usage among over-55s who identify as Asian or Asian British, our findings demonstrate that the digitalisation of essential services is in fact likely to disproportionately exclude at least some demographic groups from some minoritised communities in the UK.</p><a href=https://oro.open.ac.uk/92953/ target=_blank class="btn btn-primary">Read more</a><h2 id=digital-exclusion-or-digital-rejection-exploring-the-rejection-of-digitalised-social-rights-by-racialised-individuals-with-migration-backgrounds-in-the-uk><strong>Digital Exclusion or Digital Rejection?
