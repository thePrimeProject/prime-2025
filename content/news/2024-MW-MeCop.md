The Minoritised Ethnic People's Code of Practice for Equitable Digital Services (MECoP), developed by Dr Mark Wong, Dr Aunam Quyoum, and Ankita Mishra, has been published to enable developers, service providers and policymakers to address issues of equity in the design and delivery of digital services. 

It has already been used to provide advice by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in relation to their work on digital inclusion for the Welsh Government. 

MECoP has also been listed on the Audit Scotland’s online “Resources for Enabling Digital Inclusion” website  (targeted at organisations that support people to use digital tools and technology, alongside Audit Scotland’s report on tackling digital exclusion) and also to inform work in tackling digital exclusion and by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in their Generative AI guidance. 

The Code of Practice provides valuable evidence and guidance to address concerns about systemic exclusion and marginalisation of Minoritised Ethnic people in digital services.
