Dr Sara Bailey | September 2023 

End Digital Poverty Day, a nationwide initiative dedicated to raising awareness about the pressing issue of digital poverty in the UK, takes place annually on 12 September. This year, the PRIME team participated in End Digital Poverty Day by publishing some of the project’s key findings in a blog post for the Digital Poverty Alliance. The post centres the experiences of minority ethnic communities of digital poverty, drawing on 100 in depth interviews. Specifically, it explores the ways in which digital poverty, limited digital literacy and inadequate language support – such as translation functions on digital service platforms – present significant barriers to accessing digital services for minoritised groups. The authors, Dr. Sara Bailey, Dr. Sacha Hasan, Dr. Farjana Islam and Dr. Aunam Quyoum, conclude the post by supporting calls for the development of a new digital inclusion strategy, and urging the government to ensure that any new strategy adequately addresses the specific needs of the UK’s minoritised ethnic communities.
