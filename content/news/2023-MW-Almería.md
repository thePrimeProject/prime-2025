Dr Mark Wong | 2023

Dr Mark Wong was invited to speak at the XXIV Summer School at the University of Almería, Spain, as part of the module “Online harm and hate crime.” His talk focused on the use of co-design methods to address harms and racism experienced by Minoritised Ethnic people in digital services in the UK.

The international audience of 30 participants included professional practitioners, policymakers, and postgraduate students. The session prompted engaged discussion and Q&A, and contributed to a deeper understanding of the role of inclusive design in tackling online harms. Participants reported increased awareness of racism in digital spaces and the importance of centering the voices of Minoritised Ethnic communities in digital service development.
