Our research revealed that many minority ethnic individuals struggle with the use of online health and social housing services, and face challenges keeping themselves safe online when using social media. Our research further demonstrated that some minority ethnic individuals, upon facing challenges, feel disempowered and are unaware of the actions they could take to tackle the challenges they face. In some cases, the research participants even reported withdrawing from or delaying accessing services. 

In this context, we produced three educational videos on online health (general practice services), online social housing services, and social media. The objectives of the videos are to: share key research findings regarding the nature of online harms experienced in the context of online health services, online social housing services, and social media usage; identify protective measures that can be taken; and signpost minority ethnic individuals to sources of assistance. 

he videos have been produced in English and eight other languages spoken by the UKâ€™s main minority ethnic communities, as non-proficient English speakers faced particular difficulties with the transition to online services and the use of social media. The eight other languages are as follows: Bengali, Cantonese, Gujarati, Hindi, Mandarin, Punjabi, Somali and Urdu. All of the videos are available to view on YouTube. 

The PRIME project will carry out an evaluation of the videos during the week commencing 10 March. This will involve: a) showing the videos to individuals of Black, Caribbean, Chinese and Pakistani heritages and b) administering a questionnaire and conducting focus groups with these individuals. The video evaluation will assist us to ascertain whether viewing the videos generates impact, for example, in the form of attitudinal (e.g. a greater willingness to consider using online services) or behavioural change (e.g. a greater willingness to seek support when struggling to use online services).
