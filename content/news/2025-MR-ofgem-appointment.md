Dr Mehdi Rizvi | June 2025

Building up from this engagement with stakeholders during PRIME, Dr Mehdi Rizvi has been invited to join the "Consumer Protection & Accessibility” working group, in an advisory capacity, for the Consumer Consent Solution initiative by Ofgem. This initiative caters to the need to create a technical solution for consumers to grant and manage their consent for sharing their household energy data.

This particular working group will advise Ofgem on the issues of protecting consumers, accessibility, and usability, as well as barriers for the digitally disadvantaged.
