 Led by Professor Gina Netto of Heriot-Watt University, the interdisciplinary research team examined the impact of digitalisation on healthcare, housing, and energy services across the UK. Digitalising essential services risks widening inequalities for minoritised ethnic communities. 
 
 Conducted in four locations – Bradford, Manchester, Glasgow and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets – the study highlights the particular issues that minoritised ethnic communities face when essential services move largely online.Researchers found that poorly designed digital platforms, combined with a lack of support and inadequate regulatory oversight, could further marginalise vulnerable groups.
