Based on our interviews with 100 minoritized ethnic individuals living in England and Scotland, the blog post discusses how digital poverty, limited digital literacy, and inadequate language support are hindering access to digitalized services for minoritized ethnic communities. It highlights the challenges faced by these communities, such as lack of access to technology, the internet, and digital skills. The post emphasizes the need for tailored support and solutions to bridge this digital divide and ensure equitable access to essential services for all members of society. It also calls for collaborative efforts between government, organizations, and communities to address these issues effectively.
