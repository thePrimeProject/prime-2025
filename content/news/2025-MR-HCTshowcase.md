Dr Mehdi Rizvi represented the PRIME project at a major showcase event hosted by Heriot-Watt University’s Global Research Institute in Health and Care Technologies. The event, held on Heriot-Watt’s Edinburgh campus, highlighted research that aims to transform health and care globally through innovation and cross-sector collaboration.

Dr Rizvi presented a technical demo titled “Supporting Minoritised Ethnic Communities’ Equitable Access to Digital Health Services.” This demo is based on the work done by the Computer Science team of the PRIME project which includes Prof Wei Pang, Prof Lynne Baillie, Dr Siamak Shahandashti, Dr Mehdi Rizvi, Dr Yingfang Yuan, Dr Sebati Ghosh, Dr Paulina Lewinska, Kefan Chen, Andy Edmondson, Anupam Shankar Anil Kumar, Vijaya Balan Jagadeesan, Favour Jacob, and Charles Dodd. His demo drew attention to the challenges faced by health stakeholders to better understand the needs and concerns of marginalised groups in accessing digital healthcare, by generating personas from public datasets.

The event featured keynote speeches, including opening remarks from the UK’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sir Chris Whitty, as well as technology exhibitions and networking with healthcare leaders, policymakers, patients, and the public.
