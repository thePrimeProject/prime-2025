Dr Mark Wong | May 2022


Dr Mark Wong was interviewed for a podcast series, Spotlight, hosted by the University of Glasgow. I discussed the harms and bias in AI and data on Minoritised Ethnic people, with podcast host, Prof. Graeme Roy (Dean of External Engagement, College of Social Science, University of Glasgow). In the podcast, I also added new understanding to the importance of how we collect ethnicity data and information to inform public policy - and how the methods we use to collect and process information can themselves lead to biases in decision-making. The podcast is available on major podcast platforms, including Spotify, Apple Podcast, Google Podcast. The podcast series is widely listened to by Scottish policy makers, civil servants, and general public, with on average more than a hundred listeners per episode.
