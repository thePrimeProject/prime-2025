Dr Gina Netto and Prof Lynne Baillie | February 2022

The launch of the PRIME project received national broadcast coverage through both television and radio. Principal Investigator Dr Gina Netto presented the aims and expected outcomes of the project on STV during the week beginning 7 February 2022. On 15 February 2022, Dr Netto was also interviewed on BBC Radio Scotland’s flagship news programme, followed by Prof Lynne Baillie appearing on BBC’s Lunchtime Live the same day.

These media engagements reached a broad national audience of over 500 people, significantly raising awareness of the PRIME project. As a result, the team received follow-up requests for involvement and participation from individuals and organisations interested in the project’s focus on digital inclusion and equity for minoritised ethnic communities.
