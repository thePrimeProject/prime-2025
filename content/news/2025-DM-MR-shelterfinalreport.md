Shelter has published a new report called 'My colour speaks before me'. This peer-led research shows how racism and discrimination affect Black and Black Mixed heritage peopleâ€™s access to social homes in England. PRIME team members Dr Mehdi Rizvi and Dr Deborah Menezes were part of this effort as members of the stakeholder advisory group for this project.
