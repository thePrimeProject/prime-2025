A survey has been designed, piloted and translated into several community languages and is ready for launch later in March 2023. The survey is expected to hear from 1000 people who identify as a minoritised ethnic individual living in England and Scotland. We are working closely with our community partners to administer the survey and ensure our sample is reflective of the diversity of minoritised ethnic communities living in the UK. The results of the survey will provide a rich dataset which our PRIME team - with both machine learning and social research expertise - can analyse to identify patterns, behaviours, trends and model future risks.
