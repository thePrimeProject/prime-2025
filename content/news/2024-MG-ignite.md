PRIME team members have won a new funding from the IGNITE Network+ Flexible Fund worth £20000. The project titled "Navigating EDI Complexity: Addressing Challenges in the Energy Research Sector" would be led by Dr Mennan Guder (Cranfield University), with co-leads Prof. Nazmiye Balta-Ozkan (Cranfield University) and Dr Pegah Mirzania (Cranfield University)
 


This project investigates the impact of workforce diversity in the UK energy sector on the development and user satisfaction of digital applications, particularly among minority ethnic communities. Through surveys and focus groups, it explores how demographics, qualifications, and socio-economic factors influence application performance and acceptance, while also assessing user experiences with energy-related digital services. The findings will inform a statistical model to enhance diversity in development teams and improve the inclusivity of energy applications.
