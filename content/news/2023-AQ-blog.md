Dr Aunam Quyoum

The PRIME project Research Associate, Dr Aunam Quyoum, has written a blog post discusses how data systems are embedded in existing patterns of social and racial inequality, and can therefore reproduce discriminatory outcomes. The blog post has been cited and shared with more than 150 policymakers and civil servants in talks that Dr. Quyoum and Dr. Mark Wong conducted in 2022. This includes: 1) the Ofcom internal academic seminar Quyoum and Wong presented at, attended by more than 140 civil servants and officials of UK government's communications regulator, Ofcom, and; 2) the REPHRAIN policy salon session attended by the UK Government's National Crime Agency, Ofcom, and National Police Chiefs Council. The blog post, hosted by the University of Glasgow, outlines a new and more nuanced understanding on the limitations of data and AI and what this means for Minoritised Ethnic people. The piece concludes by critiquing and inviting the readers to question: how reliable is this system, what level of bias might it contain, how fair is this outcome and what inequalities could this perpetuate? The texts of the blog have also been reproduced in a roller banner and leaflets that are displayed in the University of Glasgow's Advanced Research Centre, and have been distributed through interactions and exchange with third sector/community organisations, professional practitioners, public members, and other academics within and outside of our institution.
