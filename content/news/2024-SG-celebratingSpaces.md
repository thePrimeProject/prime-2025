Dr Sebati Ghosh | June 2024

PRIME researcher Dr Sebati Ghosh presented the PRIME project at Celebrating Spaces, a regional open day hosted by the University of York aimed at connecting early-career researchers with wider audiences, including industry, the public, and the third sector.

The event attracted over 100 attendees from a diverse mix of backgrounds, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, professionals, and members of the general public. The PRIME presentation introduced the projectâ€™s goals and activities, sparking lively discussions about how challenges faced by minoritised ethnic communities in accessing digital and public services often reflect broader systemic issues. The session helped foster understanding and interest in collaborative approaches to tackling inequality.
