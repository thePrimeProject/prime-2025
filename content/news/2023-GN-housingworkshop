Prof Gina Netto, Principal Investigator of the PRIME project, organised a workshop in collaboration with the Manchester-based Caribbean African Health Network, a key community partner. The event brought together 50 participants—primarily professional practitioners from housing associations and community organisations—to engage with findings from research on access to social housing in England.

The national-level workshop created a platform for dialogue around housing inequalities affecting minority ethnic communities. Attendees included policymakers and representatives from third sector organisations. Following the event, many participants reported greater awareness of the barriers faced by these communities and expressed intentions to implement more inclusive practices and increase organisational accountability.

A second workshop was organised an online with Shelter Scotland and the Caribbean and African Health Network to raise awareness of the project findings relating to access and use of digitalised social housing services in Scotland. Participants included representatives from Government, local authorities, housing associations, homelessness charities and researchers. Discussion focused on measures which were already in place to increase access to such services among minoritised ethnic communities as well as further actions which could be taken either singly or in collaboration with others.
