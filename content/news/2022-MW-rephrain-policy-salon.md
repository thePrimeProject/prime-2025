Dr Mark Wong and  Dr Aunam Quyoum

15 civil servants and representatives of government/public sector organisation attended a talk given by me (Mark Wong) and our project Research Associate, Aunam Quyoum, both at University of Glasgow, about the project. The talk was part of a series of REPHRAIN's monthly hour-long “Policy Salons” held online, as part of a new initiative aimed at encouraging knowledge exchange and open discussions between policy makers, law enforcement agencies and REPHRAIN, the national centre of excellence on cybersecurity based at University of Bristol. In attendance of the talk were representatives from UK Government's National Crime Agency (social-techncial group, cybersecurity), Ofcom (research team on violence against women and girls), National Police Chief's Councils (Violence against women and girls taskforce), and REPHRAIN (deputy director). The talk was followed by a Q&A about the project's research and how it engages with Minoritised Ethnic people and community organisations in co-design of data and AI. Questions and discussions were also had around the role of trust in digital services and underlying systemic racism in such systems. Further information on co-design and engagement with marginalised communities were requested by civil servants/policy representatives in attendance.
