Dr Mehdi Rizvi is a researcher working on the PRIME project, with expertise in Human Computer Interaction. Rizvi’s research focuses on the design of interdisciplinary tools and platforms for citizens and domain-experts. Such tools often  follow the no-code/low-code paradigm, tangible interaction,  or easy to use toolkits, making the interaction by end-users easier. Outcomes of his work have been published in various international research journals and conference proceedings, and also have been exhibited to general public in the form of interactive art exhibitions.  His work in PRIME focuses on creating and evaluating Privacy Enhancing Toolkits (PETs) for minority ethinic communities.
