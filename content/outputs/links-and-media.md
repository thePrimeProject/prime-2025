# Video report on PRIME findings
## "Digitalising essential services risks widening inequalities for minoritised ethnic communities"

Led by Professor Gina Netto of Heriot-Watt University, the interdisciplinary research team examined the impact of digitalisation on healthcare, housing, and energy services across the UK. Conducted in four locations – Bradford, Manchester, Glasgow and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets – the study highlights the particular issues that minoritised ethnic communities face when essential services move largely online.

Researchers found that poorly designed digital platforms, combined with a lack of support and inadequate regulatory oversight, could further marginalise vulnerable groups.
