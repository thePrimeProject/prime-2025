# Invited panel speaker at SCVO’s The Gathering

## Putting people and values at the heart of Al

Dr Mark Wong was invited to speak on a panel titled “Putting People and Values at the Heart of AI” at The Gathering, the annual flagship event hosted by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO). The panel focused on ethical, inclusive, and community-driven approaches to artificial intelligence and digital innovation.

Held in Scotland, this regional event attracted over 200 attendees, including professional practitioners, policymakers, and members of the public. Dr Wong’ contribution helped highlight the importance of embedding values and public engagement into AI development. The session led to plans for future collaboration and follow-up activity on value-led technology within the voluntary and public sectors.
