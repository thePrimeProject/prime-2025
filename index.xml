The presentation took a deep dive into the experiences of older Asian and Asian British-identifying adults of using digital healthcare, housing and energy services. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Asian and Asian-British individuals over the age of 55 are significantly less likely to use the internet than White individuals in the same age category.</description></item><item><title>Prime Interviews Completed</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/prime-interviews-completed/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 19:26:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/prime-interviews-completed/</guid><description>The PRIME team has gained detailed insight into the various challenges minioritised ethnic citizens are facing when trying to access digital health, energy and housing services. The task to conduct 100 interviews with individuals across England and Scotland, was made possible by working in collaboration with our community organisation partners. In particular, our community partners supported us to recruit many minoritised ethnic individuals who do not currently use digital services effectively or who may have been reluctant to participate in an academic research project otherwise.</description></item><item><title>PRIME Multi-disciplinary Presentations at REPHRAIN’s ‘All Hands Meeting’ in Edinburgh</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/prime-md-presentation-rephrain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 19:17:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/prime-md-presentation-rephrain/</guid><description>Dr. Sara Bailey | 18 July 2024
Now that the hard work of data collection and data analysis is drawing to a close, the project team was delighted to have the opportunity to bring together researchers from both the social and computer sciences to provide a cross-disciplinary overview of our key findings to partners and stakeholders at the May 2024 ‘All Hands Meeting’ which was convened by REPHRAIN.
Of course, with 10 months remaining on the project, a good deal of work still remains to be done, especially for the team members involved in developing privacy-enhancing technologies and explainable AI that will help mitigate the online harms faced by minoritised ethnic (ME) communities when accessing online services, but this was a valuable opportunity to reflect on the progress made across the project so far.</description></item><item><title>Best Paper Presentation Award</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2024-bestpaper-icsp2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2024-bestpaper-icsp2024/</guid><description>Prof Wei Pang, one of the Co-I&amp;rsquo;s of the project has won the Best Paper Presentation Award for his presentation titled “Quantifying Discrepancies in Online User Experiences and Modelling Geodemographic Data with Graph Neural Networks: Some Results from the PRIME Project”.

It highlights the challenges faced by these communities, such as lack of access to technology, the internet, and digital skills. The post emphasizes the need for tailored support and solutions to bridge this digital divide and ensure equitable access to essential services for all members of society.</description></item><item><title>Presentation at REPHRAIN Showcase 2023</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-gn-rephrain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-gn-rephrain/</guid><description>Prof Gina Netto, PI PRIME, presentated about the PRIME project to delegates from industry, academia, government bodies and regulators.

The blog post has been cited and shared with more than 150 policymakers and civil servants in talks that Dr. Quyoum and Dr. Mark Wong conducted in 2022. This includes: 1) the Ofcom internal academic seminar Quyoum and Wong presented at, attended by more than 140 civil servants and officials of UK government&amp;rsquo;s communications regulator, Ofcom, and; 2) the REPHRAIN policy salon session attended by the UK Government&amp;rsquo;s National Crime Agency, Ofcom, and National Police Chiefs Council.</description></item><item><title>New podcast about harms and bias in AI and data on Minoritised Ethnic people</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2022-mw-podcast/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2022-mw-podcast/</guid><description>Dr Mark Wong was interviewed for a podcast series, Spotlight, hosted by the University of Glasgow.
