      <description>Published Papers An Integrated Agent-Based Modelling and Machine Learning Framework for Enhancing the Digital Service Access of Minority Ethnic Communities Mennan Guder and Nazmiye Balta-Ozkan This paper introduces an integrated modelling framework combining Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) and Machine Learning (ML) to enhance digital service access for Minority Ethnic (ME) communities, specifically drawing on the Protecting Minority Ethnic Communities Online (PRIME) project. The framework leverages ML models to derive unbiased decision-making rules, influencing ABM simulations that explore online service perceptions based on individual attributes and environmental factors.</description>

We are working closely with our community partners to administer the survey and ensure our sample is reflective of the diversity of minoritised ethnic communities living in the UK.</description>

      <description>In September 2023, PRIME project team members Dr Sara Bailey, Professor Agnes Kukulska-Hulme and Dr Elizabeth FitzGerald presented some of the PRIME project’s key findings at the University of Liverpool-hosted Digital Inclusion Policy and Research Conference (DIPRC 2023). The presentation took a deep dive into the experiences of older Asian and Asian British-identifying adults of using digital healthcare, housing and energy services. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Asian and Asian-British individuals over the age of 55 are significantly less likely to use the internet than White individuals in the same age category.</description>

      <description>The PRIME team has gained detailed insight into the various challenges minioritised ethnic citizens are facing when trying to access digital health, energy and housing services. The task to conduct 100 interviews with individuals across England and Scotland, was made possible by working in collaboration with our community organisation partners. In particular, our community partners supported us to recruit many minoritised ethnic individuals who do not currently use digital services effectively or who may have been reluctant to participate in an academic research project otherwise.</description>

      <description>Dr. Sara Bailey | 18 July 2024&#xA;Now that the hard work of data collection and data analysis is drawing to a close, the project team was delighted to have the opportunity to bring together researchers from both the social and computer sciences to provide a cross-disciplinary overview of our key findings to partners and stakeholders at the May 2024 ‘All Hands Meeting’ which was convened by REPHRAIN.&#xA;Of course, with 10 months remaining on the project, a good deal of work still remains to be done, especially for the team members involved in developing privacy-enhancing technologies and explainable AI that will help mitigate the online harms faced by minoritised ethnic (ME) communities when accessing online services, but this was a valuable opportunity to reflect on the progress made across the project so far.</description>
