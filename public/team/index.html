  <div class="team-content"> <p>My research explores the relationship between the lived experiences of individuals with a migration history and the engagement of public and other organisations with such individuals. Areas of focus include minoritised ethnic communities’ access to, experiences of and outcomes of engaging with key public services (including housing, health and social care services); participation in the labour market and creative industries; identity negotiation in multilingual physical and virtual environments, and approaches to tackling hate crime. Many of these interests have informed and will continue to shape the PRIME project.</p>

She has empirical experience of working with socio-economically disadvantaged and minoritised communities in the UK and in the countries of the Global South. She is a co-convenor of the BSA Race &amp; Ethnicity Study Group and currently her works focus on exploring shapes and forms of health inequalities and housing challenges as perceived by the underserved and marginalised groups in the UK. Previously, her doctoral research explored how the Olympic 2012 legacy-led regeneration was contributing socio-economic exclusions to the three distinct ethnic minority communities (e.g. South Asian-British Bangladeshi, Black African and Black Caribbean) in East London. In addition to her work on PRIME she also works as a Research Fellow at the Wolfson Institute of Population Health at Queen Mary University of London.</p>
