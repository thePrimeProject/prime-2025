    <div class="team-content"><p>My research explores the relationship between the lived experiences of individuals with a migration history and the engagement of public and other organisations with such individuals. Areas of focus include minoritised ethnic communities’ access to, experiences of and outcomes of engaging with key public services (including housing, health and social care services); participation in the labour market and creative industries; identity negotiation in multilingual physical and virtual environments, and approaches to tackling hate crime. Many of these interests have informed and will continue to shape the PRIME project.</p>

Rizvi’s research focuses on the design of interdisciplinary tools and platforms for citizens and domain-experts. Such tools often  follow the no-code/low-code paradigm, tangible interaction,  or easy to use toolkits, making the interaction by end-users easier. Outcomes of his work have been published in various international research journals and conference proceedings, and also have been exhibited to general public in the form of interactive art exhibitions.  His work in PRIME focuses on creating and evaluating Privacy Enhancing Toolkits (PETs) for minority ethinic communities.</p>
