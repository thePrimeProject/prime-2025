Our research revealed that many minority ethnic individuals struggle with the use of online health and social housing services, and face challenges keeping themselves safe online when using social media. Our research further demonstrated that some minority ethnic individuals, upon facing challenges, feel disempowered and are unaware of the actions they could take to tackle the challenges they face. In some cases, the research participants even reported withdrawing from or delaying accessing services.</description></item><item><title>Best Paper Presentation Award at 10th International Conference on Signal Processing 2024</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2024-bestpaper-icsp2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2024-bestpaper-icsp2024/</guid><description>Prof Wei Pang | 21 December 2024

Now that the hard work of data collection and data analysis is drawing to a close, the project team was delighted to have the opportunity to bring together researchers from both the social and computer sciences to provide a cross-disciplinary overview of our key findings to partners and stakeholders at the May 2024 ‘All Hands Meeting’ which was convened by REPHRAIN.
Of course, with 10 months remaining on the project, a good deal of work still remains to be done, especially for the team members involved in developing privacy-enhancing technologies and explainable AI that will help mitigate the online harms faced by minoritised ethnic (ME) communities when accessing online services, but this was a valuable opportunity to reflect on the progress made across the project so far.</description></item><item><title>Appointment to Shelter's Stakeholder Advisory Group for Racism and Housing: Access to Social Housing</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2024-mr-dm-shelter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2024-mr-dm-shelter/</guid><description>Dr Mehdi Rizvi and Dr Deborah Menezes | April 2024

In September 2023, PRIME project team members Dr Sara Bailey, Professor Agnes Kukulska-Hulme and Dr Elizabeth FitzGerald presented some of the PRIME project’s key findings at the University of Liverpool-hosted Digital Inclusion Policy and Research Conference (DIPRC 2023). The presentation took a deep dive into the experiences of older Asian and Asian British-identifying adults of using digital healthcare, housing and energy services. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Asian and Asian-British individuals over the age of 55 are significantly less likely to use the internet than White individuals in the same age category.</description></item><item><title>Blog post published at Digital Poverty Alliance</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-ak-digitalpovertyalliance-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-ak-digitalpovertyalliance-blog/</guid><description>Sara Bailey, Sacha Hasan, Farjana Islam, Aunam Quyoum | September 2023
Based on our interviews with 100 minoritized ethnic individuals living in England and Scotland, the blog post discusses how digital poverty, limited digital literacy, and inadequate language support are hindering access to digitalized services for minoritized ethnic communities. It highlights the challenges faced by these communities, such as lack of access to technology, the internet, and digital skills. The post emphasizes the need for tailored support and solutions to bridge this digital divide and ensure equitable access to essential services for all members of society.</description></item><item><title>PRIME Panel at the Scottish AI Summit</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-prime-panel-scotttish-summit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-prime-panel-scotttish-summit/</guid><description>Prof Gina Netto, Prof Lynne Baillie, Dr Aunam Quyoum | April 2023

A survey has been designed, piloted and translated into several community languages and is ready for launch later in March 2023. The survey is expected to hear from 1000 people who identify as a minoritised ethnic individual living in England and Scotland. We are working closely with our community partners to administer the survey and ensure our sample is reflective of the diversity of minoritised ethnic communities living in the UK.</description></item><item><title>Prime Interviews Completed</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-prime-interviews-completed/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 19:26:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-prime-interviews-completed/</guid><description>Dr Aunam Quyoum | 1 March 2023
The PRIME team has gained detailed insight into the various challenges minioritised ethnic citizens are facing when trying to access digital health, energy and housing services. The task to conduct 100 interviews with individuals across England and Scotland, was made possible by working in collaboration with our community organisation partners. In particular, our community partners supported us to recruit many minoritised ethnic individuals who do not currently use digital services effectively or who may have been reluctant to participate in an academic research project otherwise.</description></item><item><title>Presentation at REPHRAIN Showcase 2023</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-gn-rephrain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2023-gn-rephrain/</guid><description>PRIME team presentated the PRIME project to delegates from industry, academia, government bodies and regulators.

The PRIME project Research Associate, Dr Aunam Quyoum, has written a blog post discusses how data systems are embedded in existing patterns of social and racial inequality, and can therefore reproduce discriminatory outcomes. The blog post has been cited and shared with more than 150 policymakers and civil servants in talks that Dr. Quyoum and Dr. Mark Wong conducted in 2022. This includes: 1) the Ofcom internal academic seminar Quyoum and Wong presented at, attended by more than 140 civil servants and officials of UK government&amp;rsquo;s communications regulator, Ofcom, and; 2) the REPHRAIN policy salon session attended by the UK Government&amp;rsquo;s National Crime Agency, Ofcom, and National Police Chiefs Council.</description></item><item><title>New podcast about harms and bias in AI and data on Minoritised Ethnic people</title><link>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2022-mw-podcast/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 19:29:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.primecommunities.online/news/2022-mw-podcast/</guid><description>Dr Mark Wong | May 2022
